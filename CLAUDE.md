# Workflow
- When making changes that affect the project structure, build/test scripts, or environment variables, make sure to update the DEVELOPMENT.md file.
- Update README.md as needed for higher-level, concise information about the project's goals and structure. It should be short and geared towards someone looking for a quick overview of the project.
- After making code changes, run tests, lint, and typechecking and make sure they pass.
If you need to ignore a lint rule, give an explanation why it's necessary.
- Where possible, practice test driven development; i.e. write tests for features first, then make sure the tests pass once the feature is implemented.
